# OpenArm: An open-source robotic arm for human manipulation data collection

![DSCF3185](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a5ea64c-ab9c-4994-870b-5300af98df7e)

This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [Hardware](#Hardware) and [Software](#Software) sections. In addition this, this repository also provides examples to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is support for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions to the setup for these features are detailed in the [Simulation](#Simulation) and [Teleoperation](#Teleoperation) sections.

The CAD for the OpenArm v1 project can be accessed on OnShape through the following link: 
- [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b4c9f28b9b00f7d40a1a4250/w/fe370058f6ecce02af3b0093/e/c7e7f88d1c11b5ea0a83ba7c?renderMode=0&uiState=67b590ed2d89b65cc3bf2317)

Machined, sheet metal, and off-the-shelf components can be purchased through MISUMi and Misumi and its manufacturing service Meviy, but similar services worldwide can also be used to procure the necessary parts. The Purchasing List/Bill of Materials can be found on the OnShape, as well as the Assembly Guide. 

## üíæSoftware
OpenArm‚Äôs software stack includes real-time motor control examples, enabling users to quickly set up and start moving the arm. It also provides motor calibration tools, a SocketCAN driver, and a step-by-step tutorials on setting up the CAN interface.
